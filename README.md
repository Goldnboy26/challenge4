# challenge4
for this assigment I really did push myself in order to complete this challenge4, I had alot of fun putting toguether alot of code. Did plenty of math
on some of the formulas in order to come up with the time, and make sure it would make sense to the computer when it would read it. finally, am begining
to understand more about javaScript and am looking forward to continue to learn more about it.
